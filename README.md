# Analytics-102
2017 Summer Analytics Course released by Consulting and Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati.
We created a simple course for students of IIT Guwahati, released by the Consulting and Analytics Club of IIT Guwahati, to teach data manipulation and simple regression techniques.
We provided participants with day-wise videos, documentations, tasks to understand various concepts, and apply them to a given dataset.
I created kernels in both languages, R and Python, on Kaggle, for participants to use as reference, which I have uploaded here. You can view the Kaggle kernels at the following link.
